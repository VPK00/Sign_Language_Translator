I am excited to share my project, a prototype for sign language translator using flex sensors and Arduino Uno. This innovative project aims to bridge the communication gap between individuals with hearing impairments and those who are not familiar with sign language.

Using flex sensors, which are thin and flexible devices that measure the bending of fingers, combined with an Arduino Uno microcontroller, I developed a real-time sign language recognition system. The flex sensors are strategically placed on a glove worn by the user, capturing the finger movements and translating them into corresponding letters or words.

Throughout the development process, I faced various challenges such as sensor calibration and optimizing the recognition algorithm. However, I was able to achieve accurate and reliable translation results.

This project holds immense potential in facilitating communication and promoting inclusivity for individuals with hearing impairments.
